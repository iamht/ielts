The lyrics of her songs are honest and truthful, vulnerable and relatable. Her songs speak to relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. She preaches self- empowerment and liberation.

As a member of this club, I have become better acquainted with Professor Lee as well as his opinions and interests.<br><br>Professor Lee is extremely passionate about protecting the environment and I find his ideas to be both interesting and admirable.<br><br>For example, one of Professor Lee's missions in life is to lessen the negative impact of plastics on the environment. He points out that many plastics are a danger to the environment, as they are not biodegradable. Plastic water bottles, for example, can take up to 200 years to biodegrade, and, at the rate we are using plastic bottles, it seems that the earth will be soon overrun with those bottles and other plastic items. From a club meeting, learned that Professor Lee is working with other scientists and engineers to come up with a plastic material that is biodegradable within a much shorter period of time, preferably three to six months. I think this is a fantastic idea and I do hope this project can succeed.",
